# Understanding Value in the UK Used Car Market in 2022

# Context

This project was completed as part of the General Assembly Data Science Immersive bootcamp. This document discusses the problem, hypothesis, methodology, conclusion, and tools used.

# Background and Problem Statement

The second-hand car market in the UK is currently thriving due to the shortage of new models and cars under three years of age. According to [some figures](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58150025) the used car market has grown astronomically since the pandemic began, with more than 2.2 million used cars exchanged since 2019.  

A global shortage of computer chips used in car production, as well as other materials such as copper, aluminium and cobalt, has led to fewer new vehicles rolling off production lines. That has meant more buyers turning to the used-car market. Of course the car industry has not been the only industry to suffer from the global chip shortage, but despite popular demand, the car industry has struggled to deliver brand new cars to buyers. Computer chips are used in everything from modern infotainment systems, windscreen wipers and electric car batteries to name a few.

Itâ€™s estimated the chip crisis will cause 100,000 vehicles to not be delivered before the end of 2021, representing a huge blow for the industry. 

<b>Given that the chip shortage is unlikely to be resolved in the immediate future, now more than ever it would be helpful to be able to identify good value in the UK used car market. That is what this project intends to do.</b>

# Objectives

My primary objective for this project is to:

* Generate a predictive model for used car price in the UK in 2022.
* The final model must be interpretable.

My secondary objective is to test the hypothesis that:

* When all other car attributes are equal, A Dacia branded car is cheaper than a Volvo branded car.

# Data Acquisition

The data for this project came from [autotrader.co.uk](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/). Although AutoTrader do have an API, access is only permitted with a commercial contract. As such, the project data had to be obtained through use of a web scraper. Figure 1 below describes a typical search result on autotrader.co.uk

<br>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<kbd><img src="images/autotrader.png" width="700"  /></kbd>
</p>
<p align="center"><i><sub><b>Figure 1:</b> Sample autotrader.co.uk search result page with scraped fields highlighted in green.</sub></i></p>
<br>

Evidently, each car listing is rich in information. At this early stage in the project a 'more is more' approach was adopted. It was intended to gather all information in as few web scrapes as possible, without duplicating work by going back to revisit a car listing at a later date. Of particular interest was the free-form text box between car year and car price - often where car listings were lacking in specific details such as BHP, engine size or number of doors, they could be found and recovered from this string using RegEx. 

Over 400,000 new and used cars were successfully scraped from AutoTrader. 

Two problems overcome during web scraping:
* Problem 1 involved a hard limit on the search results. Search results were limited to 1000 car listings per search. This is not a problem if the search criteria are highly specific as the platform would expect, although for this project it was important to return all car listings. To navigate this problem, thousands of complimentary searches were performed and the number of returned results were verified to be less than 1000 before continuing to scrape the data.
* The solution to problem 1 likely contributed to problem 2; the searching behaviour was being flagged as problematic by the website. AutoTrader employ Cloudflare website security to prevent algorithms like this overloading their server with requests. The security successfuly prevented the Python Requests package from gaining access to search results, however switching to Cloudscraper instead resolved all issues. 

After a small number of iterative improvements to the web scraping function, the dataset was scraped in four days in the week commencing 31/01/2022. This is the date at which data are accurate.

# Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

The AutoTrader dataset has been gathered from car listings which are posted by thousands of dealers across the UK. As such, the car listings can be a little variable in terms of content and quality. Full details on the data cleaning performed in this project are availble in the <b>LINKED JUPYTER NOTEBOOK</b>, with some of the more interesting parts summarised below:
* BHP data were standardised in terms of units. Some more recent cars were reported in units of PS - the German equivalent.
* Dealer location and rating data were extracted from the associated dealer href.
* Engine size was populated using RegEx - see figure 3 below. This was particularly problematic for electric vehicles as they don't have cylinders. in the engine and measure size in units of kilowatts instead of litres. An additional e_engine column was added to differentiate.
* Number of doors was populated and standardised using RegEx. Interestingly pickup trucks describe doors in a different way to all other cars.
* Added a used/new flag to allow for simple filtering.
* Utilised GeoPy with the Google Maps API to obtain dealer county information. This involved moving from dealer location, which was often a city or an area, to dealer latitude and longitude before reverting back to dealder county.

```python3
# Iterate over missing engine rows and use RegEx on name_subtitle to extract engine 
# size where possible. Note that electric engines are handled differently.

for index, car in ucars[ucars['engine'].isnull()].iterrows():
    car_subname = ucars.loc[index, 'name_subtitle']
    try:
        enginesize = re.findall('([0-9][.][0-9]+)',car_subname)[0]
    except: 
        enginesize = np.nan
    ucars.loc[index,'engine'] = float(enginesize)
```
</p>
<p align="center"><i><sub><b>Figure 3:</b> Sample data cleaning codeblock using RegEx to extract missing engine size data.</sub></i></p>
<br>

With all data cleaning and feature engineering finished, there were 400,247 new and used cars in the dataset. 378,597 of these were used cars, which this project focuses on. A [data dictionary file](data_dictionary.md) has been prepared to provide further detail. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Although this is a used car project, data have been scraped and cleaned for both new and used cars. It was at this point, the beginning of the EDA that new cars were dropped to focus on used cars only. 

There were no immediate surprises in the EDA. The dataset was scruitinised from a number of different angles to check for patterns and trends. Some of the more descriptive relatonships within the dataset are captured in figures 4-7 below, with a more comprehensive EDA to be found in the <b>LINKED JUPYTER NOTEBOOK</b>.

</p>
<p align="center"><i><sub><b>Figure 4:</b> Plot describes the quantity of used cars for sale in the UK for the 30 most common brands.</sub></i></p>
<br>

Evidently a BMW is the most common used car for sale in the UK right now, making up just under 10% of all used cars on AutoTrader. German brands do well in general, with four of the top five most common brands from Germany.

</p>
<p align="center"><i><sub><b>Figure 5:</b> Plot describes price distribution by car brand for each of the 16 most common car brands.</sub></i></p>
<br>

Figure 5 tells many stories about the price distribution of the different car brands displayed. Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo stand out as some of the most expensive used cars brands, with Vauxhall and Renault the least expensive. beyond this the skew of each brand distribution tells of how varied their car offering is. The high skew brands such as Land Rover, Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz have a greater number of cars for sale beyond the 95th percentile and it can be deduced that these brands cater to the high-end car market as well as to their prime market between the 1st and 3rd interquartile ranges. The same cannot be said for brands like Mini, where the skew is much reduced.

<br>

The average used car value plot by year produced points out an interesting non-linear relationship between used car price and age. Average used car price seems to fall from 2022 produced cars to 2003 produced cars at which point it begins to rise slightly. This may be due to the influence of some sort of unexplained vintage-factor. The fact that this relationship is not perfeclty linear may have implications for linear models, to be broached in the modelling section.

<p align="center"><i><sub><b>Figure 7:</b> Plot describes price distribution by car transmission on the left and by car drivetrain on the right.</sub></i></p>
<br>

Figure 7 is the final plot in this EDA section and images the used car price distribution when divided by two of the categorical variables; drivetrain and transmission. Early indications show that categorical variables such as these should be valuable in determinining used car value. Manual trasmission cars are generally cheaper than automatic transmission cars and four-wheel-drive cars are generally more expensive than front-wheel-drive cars. Interestingly rear-wheel-drive cars seem to be more expensive than front-wheel-drive cars. This may becasue rear-wheel-drive cars in the UK are predominantly BMW or Mercedes-Benz, which have been identified as more expensive in figure 5. 

# Modelling

For car listing features which were used in the following modelling process, refer to blue font in figure 2.

## Selecting a Model

A range of nine regression modelling methods were evaluated on a random subset of 50,000 in order to provide a quick evaluation of model suitability. The data were train-test split in an 80:20 ratio to enable evaluation on unseen data and five fold cross-valiation was employed on the training dataset to reduce overfitting. Parameters for each model were optimised via method specific grid searching. An overview of the tested models can be found on slide 6 of the non-technical presentation or specific details can be found in section <b>X OF THE LINKED JUPYTER NOTEBOOK</b>. For this summary, the range of R<sup>2</sup> scores and corresponding price residual distributions are presented for each of the tested models in figure 8 below. 

<br>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<kbd><img src="images/modelsummary.png" width="500"  /></kbd>
</p>
<p align="center"><i><sub><b>Figure 8:</b> Summary plot of tested models. Models are sorted from in ascending order by R<sup>2</sup> score on an unseen testing dataset. Machine learning methods tested came from the Scikit-Learn and XGBoost packages. </sub></i></p>
<br>

The top four models in figure 8 are based around linear regression and yield the least impressive scores. This is likely due to some violations of the linear regression assumptions. The final five models are based in decision trees, with the final four models employing either bagging or boosting to enhance predictions. Improvements in R<sup>2</sup> score from top to bottom are reflected in the shape of residual distribution for each method - a high R<sup>2</sup> score yields a taller, narrower, residual distribution.

Although the XGBoostRegressor() marginally outperformed the GradientBoostingRegressor() on the test dataset, the GradientBoostingRegressor() model was evidenced to contain less variance.

## The Final Model

A Gradient Boosting Regressor model from the Scikit-learn package was selected as the optimal model to procede with on the full dataset; this is one of the decision tree based methods. As before, the data were train-test split in an 80:20 ratio to enable evaluation on unseen data and five fold cross-valiation was employed on the training dataset to reduce overfitting. Increasing the number of cars from 50,000 to 378,597 served to both increase model run-times and further reduce model variance.

</p>
<p align="center"><i><sub><b>Figure 9:</b> Optimal model scoring metrics evaluated on the test and train datasets. </sub></i></p>
<br>

The final model can be seen to explain 95% of the variance in used car price within the dataset that is not explained by the baseline (average) model. RMSE for the final model is approximately Â£2500 - note that this model scoring metric is weighted towards the larger errros.

# Model Interpretation

## Feature Importance

Scikit-learn can quickly produce the feature importance, or gini importance associated with the model. This is defined to be the normalised total-reduction of the criterion by each feature, or more simiply this could be interpreted as 'how helpful each of the predictors were in define tree branches within the model'. 

<br>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<kbd><img src="images/featimp.png" width="450"  /></kbd>
</p>
<p align="center"><i><sub><b>Figure 11:</b> Feature importances or Gini importances attributed to the top 10 most influential predictors within the Gradient Boosting model. </sub></i></p>
<br>

A downside to the feature importance measured above in figure 11 is that it does not capture the nature of the relationship between each of the predictors and the target, i.e. whether it a positive or negative predictor. For example, based on the distribution in figure 7 it is observe that a front-wheel-drive used car is generally cheaper or below average price, however the feature importance only informs that it is the 8th most important feature in determining used car price. This form of feature importance does not satisfy the initial objective that any produced model must be interpretable to identify value.

## Permutation Importance with ELI5 and Used Car Value Breakdown

To combat the identified shotcomings of feature importance the Explain it Like I'm 5 (ELI5) package has been utilised to calculate permutation importance. ELI5 will remove one predictor at a time from the predictor set and measure how model scoring suffers. The associated weight is then ascribed to each of the predictors. After the permutation importance has been obtained, ELI5 can be further used to provide granular detail on how each predictor variable impacts the model prediction for a given used car, and importantly whether the nature of that relationship is positive or negative. Figure 12 below steps through the way in which ELI5 has been used to generate a used car value breakdown. 

<br>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<kbd><img src="images/ELI5V2.png" width="600"  /></kbd>
</p>
<p align="center"><i><sub><b>Figure 12:</b> Engineered used car value breakdown using permutation importance from the ELI5 package.</sub></i></p>
<br>

The green and red box to the left is a raw output from ELI5's <i>show_weights</i> function, with positive predictors in green and negative predictors in red. Notice how despite this car being Ford, the fact that this car is also not a Land Rover has an impact on the predicted price. It is relationships like this which have been collapsed into a single accumulated price impact in the central table. As this feature is particularly useful, there are more examples of used car value breakdowns to be found in <b>THE LINKED NON-TECHNICAL PRESENTAION</b>.

With the ELI5 analysis of the final model in place, the inner workings of the model have become suitably explainable and transparent. The <b>LINK TO TOP</B> primary objective has been satisfied.

# Validating the Hypothesis

With the model finalised it was then possible to test the hypothesis; <i>is a Dacia cheaper than a Volvo?</i>

To verify this hypothetsis, a series of synthetics used cars were generated with identical attributes other than the car brand. These cars were then pushed into the model for price prediction and the outputs plotted below in figure 13. 

<br>
<p align="center" width="100%">
<kbd><img src="images/fakecarbrand.png" width="900"  /></kbd>
</p>
<p align="center"><i><sub><b>Figure 13:</b> Synthetic car value plot where all attributes are constant but car brand. YEar was fixed at 2018, mileage was fixed at 30000 and BHP was fixed at 100. Volvo and Dacia brands associated with the hypothesis have been coloured red.</sub></i></p>
<br>

Figure 13 illustrates that Tesla is the most expensive car brand modelled and Ssangyong is the least expensive car brand modelled. It also confirms the hypothesis that a Dacia branded car is indeed cheaper than a Volvo branded car. A Dacia is the third cheapest brand of the used cars modelled in this project. The hypothesis has been validated as true and the <b>LINK TO TOP</B> secondary project objective has been satisfied. 

# Limitations

Having satisfied both project objectives, there are a number of limitations to be aware of.
* This project relies on the assumption that the listed cars are sold at the advertised price at the time of web scraping. It is common practice to reduce the price of a car if has not been able to sell, but that would be missed by the dataset. To navigate this problem data would need to be obtained with <i>sold price</i> rather than the <i>advertised price</i> which this project is based on. This would likely require access to the commercial AutoTrader API.
* The gathered data may go stale quickly. The background to this project<b>LINK</b> noted how different pressures are acting on the UK used car market in early 2022. If these conditions were to change and the market changed too then the base data for this project would become less appropriate. If this model is to be used to inform used car buying decisions then it is recommended to gather fresh data.
* Numerous data entry errors have been identified throughout data cleaning, but only ones which could be identified as statistical anomalies. Non-remarkable data entry errors would harm the model but are difficult to identify. The gathered data is only as accurate as the used car dealers creating the car listings. 
* Finally, 'car specification' is not captured well in the dataset. Each new car on sale comes with numerous optional extras in terms of 'trim' or performance which are certainly applicable to used cars too but not well captured by this model. In fact, the largest outliers in the final price residual distribution have been attributed to unusual or rare specifications. Figure 14 below shows the car listing for the largest outlier.
