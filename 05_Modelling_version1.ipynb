    "* The initial model selection where many models are evaluated quickly on a subset of the data to assess which modelling avenues should be pursued.\n",
    "* The full-fidelity modelling on the entire dataset, using the two most promising models from the initial stage.\n",

    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1. Project Goals</b>\n",
    "* Generate a predictive model for used car price in the UK in 2022.\n",
    "    * The final model must be interpretable.\n",
    "* Test the hypothesis that when all other car features are equal, a Dacia branded car is cheaper than a Volvo branded car. \n",
    "    * Learn what the model can tell us about car brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. Metrics Utilised</b>\n",
    "* The main metric used will be R<sup>2</sup>-score, which is the amount of unexplained variance above the baseline which can be explained by the model. \n",
    "* Supplementary metrics of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) will be used to further evaluate models. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Results</b>\n",
    "* A comprehensive used car dataset was scraped from autotrader.co.uk, holding 374,000 used cars appropriate for modelling.\n",
    "* Base versions of 10 different models were evaluated and ranked using a 50,000 row subset of the used car dataset. Two models - LinearRegression() and GradientBoostingRegression() were then selected for further model optimisation on the full dataset and subsequent model evaluation. \n",
    "    * Final LinearRegression() R2 score on the price target was 0.881. \n",
    "    * <b>Final GradientBoostingRegression() R2 score on the price target was 0.953</b>. \n",
    "    * Both models proved to generalise well, with test and train R2 scores within 0.003.\n",
    "    * Of the top 10 predictors/features for each model, 6 of them were predictors/features in common.\n",
    "* ELI5 permutation importance feature has been used to explain and interpret granular detail contained within the GradientBoostingRegression() model which is not evident from the standard gini-based feature importance. \n",
    "* Dummy cars were fed into the GradientBoostingRegression() model and analysed with ELI5 to confirm that <b>a Dacia branded car is indeed cheaper than a Volvo branded car</b>.\n",
    "* No strong evidence has been found to suggest that car sale location impacts sale price, although further work is recommended.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>4. Risks/limitations/assumptions</b>\n",
    "* All used car data were gathered over two weeks between January and February 2022. At this moment the second hand car market is artificially inflated due to 'ongoing chip shortages'. As such, the accuracy of all conclusions and insights will fall with time as market conditions change. \n",
    "* Outlier analysis has revealed some data-entry mistakes on autotrader.co.uk. Data-entry mistakes which can be observed as statistical anomalies have been removed from the dataset however this by no means confirms that others don't remain.\n",
    "* When buying a new car there are often a number of tiers to choose from in terms of 'car spec'. Although some engine attributes may be incorporated in the 'BHP' statistic, much of this information is not captured at a used car sale and is not accounted for in this project. For example there is no information on whether a used car has a leather interior with rear view cameras and parking sensors.\n",
    "* Car size variables could be obtained more accurately. At this stage they have been scraped from carsized.com."

    "Where linear regression methods have a number of restrictive conditions on when they can be used, decision tree methods have none! Linear regression and logistic regression models fail in situations where the relationship between features and outcome is nonlinear or where features interact with each other. Time to shine for the decision tree! Tree based models split the data multiple times according to certain cutoff values in the features. Through splitting, different subsets of the dataset are created, with each instance belonging to one subset. The final subsets are called terminal or leaf nodes and the intermediate subsets are called internal nodes or split nodes. To predict the outcome in each leaf node, the average outcome of the training data in this node is used."

    "Random Forests consist of many decision trees - it's a bagging ensemble method. Each decision tree is built using a random subset of observations and predictors to generate the tree. Variability of the trees is introduced in this way. To obtain a prediction for a given observation(car) the observation is run through each of the individual trees in the forest and the final result from all trees is averaged. The sheer number of trees and the randomness involved in generating each one makes results more difficult to interpret than a single decision tree. "

    "First of all, AdaBoost is a boosting ensemble method. It produces a large number of weak learners with a sequential method. These are called stumps because they are decision trees with a single split. It uses a defined learning rate at each step to add more weight to the difficult observations to model and reduce weight on the ones which are already modelled well. This learning rate ensures that many small steps are taken in the model progression. New weak learners (stumps) are added sequentially to focus the training on more the difficult patterns within the data."

    "Why might I look to use a Gradient Boosting regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is a generalisation of adaptive boosting. It is also a boosting ensemble method. Similarly to AdaBoosting, a series of weak learners are iteratively produced and added to the ensemble model, however this time each weak is larger than a single branch or stump. Gradient Boosting works by first of all predicting the average value for all observations and defining a loss function to be optimised/minimised at each successive step, then weak learners are created to reduce the loss function at each step. After each step the new weak learner is added to the ensemble and the loss function re-evaluated before starting the process again. The model is considered to have converged when progressive steps fail to reduce the loss function.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Alternatively, here is my description from a non-technical summary:\n",
    "* Gradient boosting starts with a base prediction by adopting the average value for the target variable before generating sequential predictors which aim to minimise the residuals between the base prediction and the actual values. \n",
    "* Each sequential predictor is scaled by a 'learning factor' before being added to the ensemble. This is usually some small fraction like 0.1 which forces the gradient boosting ensemble model to iteratively take small steps towards a better model with minimised residuals. \n",
    "* Taking many small steps in the right direction results in better predictions with a testing dataset. i.e. lower variance. \n",
    "* The model is considered optimised when adding new scaled predictors to the ensemble fails to reduce the residual"

The main selling point of XGB over GB is that it uses 2nd order partial derivatives of the loss function to provide further detail about the direction of gradient change and how to best minimise the loss function. It's a more flexible library which I honestly haven't been able to explore as thoroughly as I would like. I've included it here in the project but do not progress with it."
